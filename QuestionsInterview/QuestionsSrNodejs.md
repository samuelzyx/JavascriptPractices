Could you give a brief of your carrear?
Answer according your experience

Wich technology do you prefer?
Answer according your preference but if this position need JS mention the tecnologies according that

Could you tell me or describes the most difficult or interesting project in that you participate?
Mention projects that uses JS as backend and frontend and how works together to provide some client solution

Nodejs is single thread or multithread?
By itself javascript is single threaded lenguage but with Nodejs Event loop we can handle multiple request efficiently through an event loop and non-blocking I/O operations, this create the illusion of concurrency allowing Nodejs to handle limited request at once.

How we can make that Nodejs simulate multithreading?
Using promises or async/await functions to handle operations running concurrently

Why Nodejs is using V8 engine?  
Google desing V8 to improve speed and efficiency in compiling and executing javascript code also it provides share same skills and libraries for developers in both client-side and server-side, also is an open-source that ensures stay up to date by the community

Could you explain what is the event loop?
Event loop makes Nodejs efficient at handly many request at once using single thread and non-blocking I/O operations (reading files or making requests) without blocking the main thread, so when an I/O operation is completed, this it will notify Nodejs through an event as callback gives the opportunity to continue with the next queue operation

What do you understand about callbacks?
Essentially is the pass or arguments to other functions, are designed to be executed after the outer function has completed or when a specific event happens

Do hear about callback hell?
Is related to complex asynchronous operations with callbacks that are difficult to read, maintain or debug


How we can solve callback hell?
Using promises or chains of promises, also we can use async await syntaxis to manage the flow of asynchronous operations

What kind of framework have been used with Nodejs?
Commonly using express and nestjs

What is dependency injection?
Is a pattern design its the way to provide an object with things that are necessary to work during the execution gives the opportunity to make more declarative code and reuse code


What do you understand about streaming in Nodejs?
Is the way to handle large data into chunks instead to load entire data in memory at once, can be for read, write or transform data also are designed to handle data in real time

What are the event emitters?
Are objects used for coordinating communication between different parts of our code in Nodejs. They acts as central hub for managing events and their corresponding listeners.

What are the difference beetween event emitters and publisher and subscriber design pattern?
-Scope event emmitters have a local or application scope, communication happens beetween components in the same nodejs application and publish subscribe involve multiple applications or services with a central message broker
-Data flow event emitters from emitter to listener, in publish-subscriber is from publisher passing message broker to subscribers
-Communication type for event emitters is with object centralized and with publish-subscriber is with message broker (decoupled)
