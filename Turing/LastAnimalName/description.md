Last Animal Name Length

You are given a string animal_sequence that consists of animal names separated by the separator character '-'. Your task is to write a function that returns the length of the last name in the sequence.

An animal name is a sequence of characters that does not contain the separator character '-'. If there are any trailing or leading | characters in the animal_sequence, your function should ignore them.

Write a function that solves this problem and includes test cases to verify its correctness.

Example 1:
Input: s = "Elephant-Tiger-Lion-"
Output: 4
Explanation: The last animal is "Lion" with length 4
