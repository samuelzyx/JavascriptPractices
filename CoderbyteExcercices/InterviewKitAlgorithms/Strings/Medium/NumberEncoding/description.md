Number Encoding

Have the function NumberEncoding(str) take the str parameter and encode the message according to the following rule: encode every letter into its corresponding numbered position in the alphabet. Symbols and spaces will also be used in the input. For example: if str is "af5c a#!" then your program should return 1653 1#!.
